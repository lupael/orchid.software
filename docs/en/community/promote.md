There are many ways to contribute to the Laravel Orchid community,
lacking technical or programming skills that also contribute to promoting Laravel Orchid.

## Web site

Help on the website always appreciated.
Of course, you will need a minimum knowledge of HTML, but no one needs you to have some cool know-how.
You can clone the site from the git repository and submit the changes.

## Use your graphics skills

There are several ways you can use your graphic skills that can benefit the whole community.

- Create new icon sets, add them to the appropriate repository and share them with the world.
- If you think that you have an idea for a better design or even for the entire user interface - we are ready to experiment!

## Help for other users

Besides, creating a good development platform, it is also extremely important for us to create a strong community around it.
¬† You can help us achieve this goal directly by helping other Laravel Orchid users.

- **Create tutorials.** At all levels, new tutorials are welcome across the community;
   from an Laravel Orchid novice to an advanced user and even to some development topics,
   for example, how to create your own extensions.
  
- **Participate in forums.** Ask questions, answer questions or solve problems of other Laravel Orchid users;
  discuss issues and features; Share tips, tricks, and tricks 
  participate in sweepstakes or contests; and meet new friends along the way.
  
  
## Spread the word!
  
First of all, keep in mind that we want to keep the community friendly, helpful, and polite; 
therefore, please encourage good behavior through your own interactions with other people in the community.

- **Write articles about Laravel Orchid** - publish articles in online magazines and blogs, or even in print.
Do not forget to add the current link (or print URL)
  
- **Create screenshots.** If you are aware of a new feature under development, consider creating one or more screenshots to illustrate this.

- **Get more developers.** If you know or meet people with programming skills, introduce them to the community and ask if they might be interested in developing Laravel Orchid.

## Sponsored the development 

If you run a business and use the package in an income-generating product, it makes sense to finance the development: this ensures that the project on which your product relies remains healthy and actively supported. It can also help you understand the Laravel Orchid community and make it easier to get developers involved. If you are an individual user and use the product, consider donating in appreciation - for example, occasionally buying me coffee üòÄ
